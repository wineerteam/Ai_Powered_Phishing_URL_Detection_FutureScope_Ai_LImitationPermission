# Ai_Powered_Phishing_URL_Detection_FutureScope_BrowserExternsion_&&_Ai_LImitationPermission_
This Is My Hackthon_Project

This is Urls Detection Using AI_ML_deep_learning 

Future Scope is Broser Extension web,app for Android and Ios

FUTURE SCOPE IS BASED ON THIS PROJECT IS AI LIMITATION PERMISSION IN Os(operating system)

USE ai_limitation_permission_is more_Secured_any os like android,windows,linux,ios 

cheek all permission and bloked cancle or Deny permission if it is malicious app or website don't give any permission 

Advantage of this app is each and every day update with help of Ai Automatically So MORE SECURED YOUR DIVICES
This Project Is Practical Implications Of Multiple Research Paper Of Summary
